# Flask_Blog
This a mock blog I wrote trying to get a better understanding of flask, which involved various fundamental functionalities:
1.  User RegisterLogin  / Logout/ User registration confirmation email
2.  Users are able to post / view posts/  comment
3.  Database maintains data models and relationship between them
4.  Routing between different web pages
5.  View Function Protection
6.  Utilized Jinja templates to realize UI
etc..
